to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

## Data Set 

[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

## Files

* __CodeBook.md__ a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
* __run_analysis.R__ performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
  + Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  + Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  + Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  + Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  + From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  
  __run this file in the directory of data set, then you will get the tidy data.__
* __tidydata.txt__ is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
